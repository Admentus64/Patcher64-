--- INFO ---
- Maximum of 255 Objects
- Maximum of 255 Actors
- Actors are not loaded if their objects are missing
- Objects are not automaticially set when changing Actors
- Careful when adding new objects and actors, the game can crash

--- EXAMPLE ---
1. Add new Actor(s) in the Actor tab and set it to Stalfos (type: Enemy)
2. Add or replace a Object in the Object tab and set it to Stalfos (type: Enemy)

--- TROUBLESHOOTING ---
Following the example above should include the Iron Knuckle
A successfully added Iron Knuckle is indicated by it's mini-boss theme playing
Make sure the coordinates place it within the map bounds
If the map crashes it could be because there are too many objects loaded
Majora's Mask has 8 MB of RAM so it can load quite a few objects
Trying removing unneeded objects to reduce the load on the RAM
Lowering the amount of actors reduces the load on the RAM to a lesser extent

--- GUIDELINES ---
1. Stick to changing only enemies and common dungeon objects if unsure
2. Avoid switching flag and switch values if unsure
3. Test regularly
4. Reset the current map when it's not working properly and try again
5. Make gradual changes
