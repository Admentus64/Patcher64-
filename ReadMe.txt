--- WARNING ---
If you're upgrading from a previous version and are using the Files\Settings folder from the previous version, you may encounter some issues.
Removing or deleting all files from that folder and restarting fixes the issue.

Reports have been going around that the compiled .exe file for the Patcher64+ Tool is considered dangerous and a virus.
I can absolutely assure you that the code present in the .exe is the exact same code found in the source code files included with each release.
Nothing more is added, and nothing less is removed.
The .exe is generated by using PS2EXE. If you do not trust the .exe file, you can stick to using the .ps1 file instead.
As said, it uses the exact same source code, so you won't be missing any features. 



===============
=== GENERAL ===
===============

Patches ROM or Virtual Console WAD files with patches.
The Patcher64+ Tool can switch to either Wii VC or Native mode.
Wii VC mode handles VC WAD titles while Native mode handles ROM files directly.
Native mode skips most of the code used in Wii VC mode, which results in a faster patching.
Supported ROM files can be found in .NES, .SFC, .SFM, .N64, .Z64 and .V64
The Patcher64+ Tool only supports the N64, NES and SNES consoles currently.

Keep in mind that:

a) Patching Majora's Mask, Super Smash Bros., Paper Mario requires their respective modes and not Free Mode, since both VC WAD titles have applied specific compression to their ROM and Boot DOL.

b) Free Mode and Inject ROM will not work with ROMs not meant for their console mode for the Wii's Virtual Console.

c) NES titles require the console mode to be set to NES mode due to their ROM file being stored differently.



===============
=== OPTIONS ===
===============

Options included:
- Change between Native Mode (uses regular ROM files) or Wii VC mode (uses .WAD files)
- Change between Consoles
- Change Game Mode for a different set of included patches
